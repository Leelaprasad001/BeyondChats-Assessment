What distinguishes an MVP from other prototypes is how it is tested.  Rather than sitting across a table, getting verbal feedback from a reviewer, you put a prototype that seems like a real product in the hands of real customers in a real-world context.  The goal is to quickly but rigorously test assumptions about the demand for your solution\\\\u2014and gain what Eric Ries calls \\\\u201cvalidated learning\\\\u201d\\\\u2014with as little wasted effort as possible.

If customers don\\\\u2019t perceive the core features to be valuable, there\\\\u2019s no point in building the rest. \\n\\nConstrained Back-End Functionality.

In my first financing, we had a pre-money valuation of $5 million for our startup, Brainstorm. Since my cofounder and I owned most of the company,  I thought that meant we were multimillionaires, at least on paper. As we saw in Startup Model #5: The Four Quadrants of Hiring this was a result of not understanding what went into a valuation. Here is another misconception of entrepreneurs who want to sell stock,', 'link': ''}, {'id': '12019', 'context': 'Securities Offered   Most of the investment would be of preferred shares, as opposed to common shares (yours).  The preferences of the preferred shares are usually in case of a liquidation event and special rights, as will be described later in the table.      Company Valuation   This is the main deal, together with the amount that constitutes the transaction (\\\\u201cHow much for how much? \\\\u201d).  Valuation defines how much what was built so far is worth.  There is no methodological way to define it, so most likely it will be negotiated based on your alternatives.  It is defined as pre-money valuation, which is the value of what was created so far, and together with the investment amount, that forms the post-money valuation\\\\u2014the value of the company once the round is finalized.  There will be an immediate derivative of this valuation, which is PPS (Price Per Share) and number of shares in the company (prior to the round).    Mathematically, this is: pre-money valuation = PPS \\\\u00d7 number of shares prior to the round.  And then the company issues new shares to the investors at the same PPS in a total amount of the investment amount.    One note: It is important to realize that while ISO/ESOP is critical to attract and retain employees, it is mostly used by the investor as a way to lower valuation.  ISO/ESOP allocation requires issuing more shares, a new share per option, essentially increasing the number of shares and therefore lowering the PPS.  So, a $10 million pre-money valuation with 10 percent ISO/ESOP is actually less than $9 million.  It is common practice that ISO/ESOP allocation comes from current shareholders and not new ones.  To have better negotiation leverage you will need another competitive offer.      Pre-emptive Rights; Right of First Refusal; Co-Sale   Pre-emptive rights\\\\u2014The investor will have the right to participate in the next round to maintain its holding; so, for example, an investor with 10 percent of the company that participates in the next round can maintain its 10 percent position.  While it may seem fine that all they want is to increase their position, it may discourage the next investor.  Or, even worse, the next investor may ask for similar terms!
